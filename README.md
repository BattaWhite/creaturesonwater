# creaturesonwater
This is just a direct upload of Xyp's original, which I got from the now-broken link here:  https://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/135743-released-lead-creatures-on-water-for-use-with-agos-loader/

I hope it's okay to do this. Please let me know if I'm doing something uncool and I'll take it back down. 

I have nothing to do with this mod, and have no idea how to fix it if it gets broken.
